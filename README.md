# Tree models to do classification for adult dataset
* Dataset can be downloaded here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
* Raw data:

## Data Preprocess: 
* Delete null values 
* remove duplicate values 
* One-hot-encoder to attributes 
* change Salary <=50k to label 0 and >50k to lable 1
* After data preprocess:

## Data Analysis 
* 
## Construct Tree models 
* Use Decision tree and Random forest models to train and predict the label for adult dataset
* The training set and test set both have labels
